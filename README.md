# Final project ECBM4040

How to run the code:

Run Project_Notebook.ipynb to run code and train DCGAN


## Function of each file:

Inpainting_test.ipynb: Used to test inpainting function with un-trained generator

Project_Notebook.ipynb: Main function to train DCGAN and implement inpainting		

data_utils: functions for preprocessing data

model.py: contains all functions neccesary for runnign DCGAN and image inpainting

model_funcs: secondary functions used by model.py

utils: mask and crop functions are located her

model.py: contains all functions neccesary for running DCGAN and image inpainting


## Data Set locations:
Run Project_notebook.ipynb should automatically download the datasets and has a link to them.
